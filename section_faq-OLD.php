							To get started, browse through available properties <a href="/property" class="underline">here</a>. You can view all relevant information provided for each property to help you make an informed investment decision.

							Each property has their own tokens representing the ownership interests in that property. In order to purchase tokens, you must first select an available property <a href="/property" class="underline">here</a>. Once you have selected a property, simply click the Invest button for that property and you will be provided with step-by-step directions on how to purchase your tokens.

							We are working on creating NFTs (non-fungible tokens) to represent ownership interests in future properties. As a potential investor, you will have the ability to own a unique NFT representing your ownership interest. We are very excited about this development and will provide more details in the near future.

							Our founders will handle all property management decisions (such as selecting tenants, setting rental amounts and handling repairs) so you don’t have to worry about anything other than collecting your rental income. They have extensive experience with rental properties and maximizing return on investment, and have good working relationships with local property managers. The property manager for each property will be entrusted with day to day operations regarding the property, including making repairs, collecting rents and other similar matters.
							<br><br>
							As an owner of the property though, you will have a say in the important decision of when to sell the property. Any property owner can propose a sale at any time. Once an owner proposes a sale, all other owners of the property will receive a notification via our platform and email to vote in favor or against a sale. If a sale is approved by a majority of the ownership interest in the property, we will list the property for sale. All offers received will be presented to the owners for a vote. If an offer is approved by a majority of the ownership interest in the property, the offer will be accepted.

							Although the real estate market is generally considered a safer investment, it can also be volatile at times. We cannot guarantee that every property will increase in value in a constant and/or consistent manner. Our founders use their extensive knowledge and experience to identify potential properties that will be profitable and less susceptible to downturns in the real estate market. However, you are responsible for your own investing decisions and Closin is not responsible for any loss on your investment. The value of your token will reflect any increase or decrease in value of the property.

							Each available property will list the purchase method so you can understand the financial implications for your potential investment. A property may be purchased with debt (e.g. a mortgage), cash, a combination of debt and cash or any other method. By investing in a property, you agree to the method of purchase. If the method of purchase or any substantial terms of purchase are changed after you make your investment and you do not agree, you are entitled to a refund of your investment amount.
